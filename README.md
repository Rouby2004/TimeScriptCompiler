## About me
I build developer tools, compilers, and performant systems that make complex ideas simple and usable. I enjoy turning language design and static analysis into practical tools that help teams move faster and ship safer code.

- ðŸ”­ Current project: TimeScriptCompiler â€” a project focused on [time-based scripting and compilation tooling](https://github.com/Rouby2004/TimeScriptCompiler).
- âš¡ Interests: compilers, language design, static analysis, developer tooling, performance optimization.
- ðŸŒ± Learning: advanced type systems, formal verification techniques, and distributed systems.
- ðŸ§© Fun fact: I love turning academic ideas into tiny, testable projects you can run in under a minute.
